Description:
    CallbackHunter provides a nifty little controller for viewing the callbacks that fired
    during your last recording session. After generating it, add the appropriate routes to
    config/routes.rb.

Example:
    ./script/generate callback_hunter HuntedCallbacks

    This will create:
       app/controllers/hunted_callbacks_controller.rb
